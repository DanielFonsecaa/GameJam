We had 11 nights to develop this game during an intense GameJam. 

Throughout the day, we attended our classes, and each evening we dedicated our time and energy exclusively to working on the game.

We were required to use the SimpleGFX library to build our project (Code For All libreary), which added an additional layer of challenge and creativity to the process.

The development of this game was challenging. We have to search on the documentation of the SimpleGrafics a lot of methods, we have a lot of problems implementing the sprites with right size and position. 
Was also very interesting do this because we could consolidate a lot. 
We also use GitHub to share the project between us.
