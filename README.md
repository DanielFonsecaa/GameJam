# GameJam
CodeForAll_ Game Jam

We had 11 nights to develop this game. It was a GameJam while having class in the day and on the night we focus on the game.

We had to use the SimpleGFX library.

You will select the player that you want. And after this you will fight one by one if you win. If you lose you will start over.

We still need to implement this game if my co-workers. 

w - jump
s - crouch
a - left
d - rigth

h - high punch
j - low punch
k - high kick
l - low kick

To high punch and kick cannot be crouched and to do low punch and kick has to be crouched
